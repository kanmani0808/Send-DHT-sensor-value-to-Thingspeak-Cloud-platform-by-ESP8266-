Step1: go to file -> Preference -> In additional Board Manager URL, Paste this "http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json" -> Click OK
Step2: From the previosu step, we can now add ESP libraries and include ESP Boards in BOards Manager.
Step3: Go to Tools -> Manage Libraries -> Install the following Libraries:
                              1) ThingSpeak by MathWorks
                              2) DHT sensor Library by Adafruit
                              3) Adafruit Unified Sensor by Adafruit
                              4) Adafruit ESP8266 by Adafruit(Not necessary)
                              5) Adafruit Sensor Calibration by Adafruit (not necessary)
step4: Go to tools -> Boards -> Board Manager -> install "esp8266 by ESP8266 community"
step5: After installing you can choose ESP boards. in tools -> boards, choose "NodeMCU 1.0(ESP-12E Module)"
step6: connect node mcu to the USB port
step7: check for the correct port and select the port. for checking the correct port :
  -> Go to Device Manager and click on ports.
  -> Find the port with Silicon labs cp210x..,
  -> this name depends on the driver which your node MCU uses.
  -> if not found manually install the driver.

step8: compile the code and upload. Open the serial monitor.
